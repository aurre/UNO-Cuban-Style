# UNO GAME Cuban Style

Enjoy playing UNO following our rules.

## Game Rules

1. This is done by keeping a running tally of the total points left in each playerâ€™s hand at the end of each round. Players with more points in total are last in places.

2. Also each hand we select the player with more points in total to assign to that player a Fly represented by an asterisk, for me and my folks known as _La Mosca_, as well as the player who won that is going to be respresented by _-_.
